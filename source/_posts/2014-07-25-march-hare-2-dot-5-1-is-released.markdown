## TL;DR

[March Hare 2.5.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/march_hare/versions/2.5.1) is
released to rubygems.org.

This is a bug fix and usability release.


## Changes Between 2.5.0 and 2.5.1

### Better Bunny Compatibility: the Heartbeat Option

`MarchHare.connect` now accepts `:heartbeat` as an alias for `:heartbeat_requested`
for better Bunny compatibility (and because API reference accidentally listed it).

GH issue: #57.
