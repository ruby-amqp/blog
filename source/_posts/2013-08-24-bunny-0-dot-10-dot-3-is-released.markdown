## TL;DR

[Bunny 0.10.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/bunny/versions/0.10.3) is released to rubygems.org.

This is a usability improvements release that is **completely backwards compatible**
with `0.10.x`.

We encourage all Bunny users to upgrade to it.


## Changes between Bunny 0.10.2 and 0.10.3

### Default Paths for TLS/SSL CA's on Linux

Bunny now will use the following TLS/SSL CA's paths on Linux by default:

 * `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` on Ubuntu/Debian
 * `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` on Amazon Linux
 * `/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem` on OpenSUSE
 * `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt` on Fedora/RHEL

and will log a warning if no CA files are available via default paths
or `:tls_ca_certificates`.
