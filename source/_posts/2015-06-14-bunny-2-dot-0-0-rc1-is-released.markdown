## TL;DR

[Bunny 2.0.0-rc1](https://rubygems.org/gems/bunny/versions/2.0.0-rc1) is released to rubygems.org.

2.0.0 is a minor feature and bug fix release that drops Ruby 1.9 and 1.8 support.


## Changes between Bunny 1.7.0 and 2.0.0

Bunny `2.0` doesn't have any breaking API changes
but drops Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 (both EOL'ed) support,
hence the version.

### Minimum Required Ruby Version is 2.0

Bunny `2.0` requires Ruby 2.0 or later.

### Reduced Timeout Use

`Bunny::ContinuationQueue#poll` no longer relies on Ruby's `Timeout` which has
numerous issues, including starting a new "interruptor" thread per operation,
which is far from efficient.

Contributed by Joe Eli McIlvain and Carl HÃ¶rberg.

### Bunny::Channel#basic_ack and Related Methods Improvements

`Bunny::Channel#basic_ack`, `Bunny::Channel#basic_nack`, and `Bunny::Channel#basic_reject`
now adjust delivery tags between connection recoveries, as well as have a default value for
the second argument.

Contributed by Wayne Conrad.

### Logger Output Remains Consistent

Setting the `@logger.progname` attribute changes the output of the logger.
This is not expected behaviour when the client provides a custom logger.
Behaviour remains unchainged when the internally initialized logger is used.

Contributed by Justin Carter.

### prefetch_count is Limited to 65535

Since `basic.qos`'s `prefetch_count` field is of type `short` in the protocol,
Bunny must enforce its maximum allowed value to `2^16 - 1` to avoid
confusing issues due to overflow.
