## TL;DR

[Bunny 0.10.7](https://rubygems.org/gems/bunny/versions/0.10.7) is released to rubygems.org.

This is a usability release that is **completely backwards compatible**
with `0.10.x`. We encourage all Bunny users to upgrade to it.


## Changes between Bunny 0.10.6 and 0.10.7

### Add timeout Bunny::ConsumerWorkPool#join

`Bunny::ConsumerWorkPool#join` now accepts an optional
timeout argument.
