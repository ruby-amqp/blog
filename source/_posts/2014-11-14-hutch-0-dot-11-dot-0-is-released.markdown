## TL;DR

[Hutch 0.11.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/hutch/versions/0.11.0) is released to rubygems.org.

This release introduces a minor feature.


## 0.11.0 â€” Nov 14th, 2014

### Publisher Confirms Support

`:force_publisher_confirms` is a new configuration option that forces `Hutch.publish` to wait
for a confirm for every message published. Note that this **will cause a significant drop in throughput**:

``` ruby
Hutch::Config.set(:force_publisher_confirms, true)
```

`Hutch::Broker#confirm_select` and `Hutch::Broker#wait_for_confirms` are new public API methods
that delegate to their respective `Bunny::Channel` counterparts. `Hutch::Broker#confirm_select`
can be used to handle confirms with a callback instead of waiting:

``` ruby
broker.confirm_select do |delivery_tag, multiple, nack|
  # ...
end
```
